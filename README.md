 Project Title: A Robust Distress Sound-Based Bird Deterrent System For Rice Farming In Uganda
  Version: 1.0
  Date: 27/03/2024
  
  Description:
  This Arduino project detects bird motion or vocalization using a PIR sensor and a microphone. It employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to identify the type of bird based on its vocalization frequency. If a known bird is detected, distress sounds specific/suitable to that bird are played to deter it from the area.

  Components:
  - Arduino Mega 2560
  - PIR Sensor
  - Microphone
  - DFPlayer Mini MP3 Module
  - LCD Display
  
  Libraries Used:
  - arduinoFFT
  - SoftwareSerial
  - DFRobotDFPlayerMini
  - LiquidCrystal_I2C
